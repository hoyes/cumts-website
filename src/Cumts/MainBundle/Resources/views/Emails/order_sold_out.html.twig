Dear {{order.firstName}} {{order.lastName}},

You just tried to order:

{{ item.itemName }}
Quantity: {{  item.quantity }}

Unfortunately, while you were completing the payment process, someone else took the last item - many apologies.
Your account has still been debited, but someone will refund the money to you in the next few days - you'll receive a
notification from Paypal when this happens.

Regards,

Cambridge University Musical Theatre Society
