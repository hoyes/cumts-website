<h1>Membership</h1>
<p>
Here you can sign up to become a member of the Cambridge University Musical Theatre Society. As well as being a necessity
for participation in our shows, it also gives you reduced price or prioritised access to our workshops, theatre trips and 
other events. Please note that membership is only open to people who are currently students in Cambridge.
</p>
<p>Membership costs just Â£10 and lasts until you graduate.</p>

<h2>Sign up online</h2>
<p>Click the link below to start the online sign up process. You will first be asked to sign in using Raven so we know 
who you are and can check whether you are already registered. After provided a few more details about yourself, you will be
taken to Paypal to make your payment.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we're not able to accept online membership submissions for students at institutions other than the University
of Cambridge at this time. If this applies to you, please e-mail <a href="mailto:membership@cumts.co.uk">membership@cumts.co.uk</a> to 
arrange an alternative payment method.</p>
